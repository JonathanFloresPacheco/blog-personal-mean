#### Introduction


Welcome to my blog, where we'll dive into the exciting world of full-stack development using Node.js, TypeScript, and MongoDB. In this article, we'll explore a project hosted on my GitHub repository, blog-personal-mean, where I've implemented a comprehensive solution for creating, reading, updating, and deleting data (CRUD operations). The backend is developed using Node.js with TypeScript and utilizes MongoDB as the database. On the frontend side, I've employed Angular 17 to create a dynamic and responsive user interface.

#### Project Overview:

The blog-personal-mean repository is a testament to the power of combining a robust backend with a sleek and modern frontend. Let's take a closer look at the key components:

1.-Node.js Backend with TypeScript:

I've built a RESTful API using Node.js, leveraging TypeScript to enhance code maintainability and readability.
The API includes endpoints for performing CRUD operations - GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
Express.js is used as the server framework to handle routing and middleware.

2.- MongoDB Database:

For data storage, I've integrated MongoDB, a NoSQL database known for its flexibility and scalability.
The backend communicates seamlessly with MongoDB to store and retrieve data efficiently.

3.-  Angular 17 Frontend:

On the frontend, Angular 17 is employed to create a dynamic and interactive user interface.
The UI facilitates user interactions such as creating new items, viewing a list of items, updating existing items, and deleting items.


#### Getting Started:

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1.- Clone the Repository:

    git clone https://github.com/JonathanFloresPacheco/blog-personal-mean.git
    cd blog-personal-mean

2.- Install Dependencies:

Navigate to the backend folder and install Node.js dependencies:

    cd backend
    npm install

Similarly, navigate to the frontend folder and install Angular dependencies:

    cd ../tempfrontendAngular
    npm install

3.- Run the Application:

Start the backend server (from the backend folder):

    npm start

Launch the frontend application (from the frontend folder):

    ng serve

Access the application in your browser at http://localhost:4200.

Now you're all set to explore and modify the project as needed! Feel free to extend the functionality, customize the UI, or integrate additional features.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
